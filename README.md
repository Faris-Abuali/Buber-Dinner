### What is this series?

- We'll build a REST API following Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design principles completely from scratch.
- We will use .NET 7, EF Core, and common patterns such as **CQRS**, **unit of work**, **repository**, **mediator**, and more üí™üèΩ
- We'll also use some awesome open-source libraries such as **MediatR**, **FluentValidation**, **ErrorOr**, **Throw**, **Mapster**, and more.
- The developing environment will be visual studio code & dotnet CLI only. We will use awesome vs code plugins for everything from sending HTTP requests to connecting to our SQL database, debugging, and peeking at JWT tokens.
- We will code and refactor multiple times to tackle the many concepts being reached. When the series will be over, you'll have a good understanding and intuition on how to use these patterns & libraries in your industry-level applications.
